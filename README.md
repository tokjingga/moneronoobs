# Monero Noobs

Monero Noobs was inspired by [anonimal_0x914409F1's post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Monero/comments/6de6gx/opinion_why_im_holding_xmr_and_will_continue_to/)

>I understand that there are sociological relationships with any technology, and I think this is great, but I believe that, throughout any drama, the technology will remain true and, if that truth is strength; the technology will reign supreme. Myself and a few others are actually doing the work to make Monero stand the test of time; to make Monero truly the best coin out there; to ensure that Monero technology will continue to have real human value: a value that future generations will depend upon. This value, to me, is truth; and this truth is strength.

>I personally don't believe in caring too much about the words or opinions of others or if someone is upset because they gambled and lost a bet; I believe that, if the code is unaffected, nothing of real value was lost. Why? Because, in our world, code value takes precedence over any other; especially over any speculative value (is that not stating the obvious?). Am I biased? I don't know. I'm paid in XMR to work on the Monero project, but I worked on Kovri for about a year without any pay - so what does that mean? If I was ever timid and weak or caved into the words or opinions of others, then Kovri wouldn't exist. If I didn't see the forest through the trees, then I wouldn't be here talking to you right now.

>I'm not defending nor endorsing anyone's actions but, since the world hasn't collapsed, I would encourage everyone to keep their eye on the prize and put aside all the bullshit of others. Maybe it's easier said than done, but I do know it's doable (#kovri-dev being a good example).

>To all the naysayers: **if you don't know how to code, I'd suggest to start learning now so you can see how powerful Monero technology really is - and is destined to be. Seriously, if only more people spent time learning to code instead of ranting on reddit...**
